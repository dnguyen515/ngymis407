Assignment 1
Java vs Python

In this assignment I will attempt to compare a couple of programming languages that may be used in contemporary business application development.

The language I am most familiar with is Java. I have used Python for one semester of college when I took an intro course to Python so I am not too familiar with it but am in the process of researching it for this assignment.

The biggest difference I can tell between Python and Java is that Python is easier to use than Java. Especially for people who are beginning to code. I am not sure if this is true or not but Java is more useful and can run on any platform but requires a steeper learning curve. Also, another big difference between the two would obviously be syntax but that different on any language.

Going into the language itself, when using Python, you have to indent to separate your code into blocks. In Java, to separate your code you use curly brackets. I am more familiar with Java so I am used to using the curly brackets but I also indent my code because it makes it easier to read. 

Another large difference between Python and Java is that in Java you have to declare a variable type when making variables and it stays that type. In Python, you create variables that you can change the type of without problems. I read on articles that say it is better to have static type variables because it reduces the risk of errors in your code by not having wrong types lost in your code.

Another difference between Java and Python is that Java can be used to create applications that are specific to platforms. Python requires you to have a compiler that turns your Python code into readable code on your system. Since Java is so popular and used everywhere, any machine that has Java virtual machine installed will be able to run Java applications.

That brings us to the next difference of speed between the two. Python runs faster than Java programs because Java programs need to be running inside Java virtual machine.
In conclusion Java seems to be the more popular choice when writing applications.
